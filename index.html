    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Swimming</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobby is swimming. I like swimming because it a competitive and individual sport where you try to improve your time. Swimming bring me joy, which is why I swim at least 2-3 times a week. I like swimming on my summer swim team and I like to swim year round in indoor pools.

    <p>In swimming you get ribbons based on how you place in your event. There are different heats in each event and different lanes in each heat. Normally, there are six swimmers in each heat for each event because the pool has space for only six lanes. If you get 5th place or higher you get a ribbon of different colors. I have won many ribbons in different events because I have swam in different swim meets.</p>
